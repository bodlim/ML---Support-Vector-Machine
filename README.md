# ML---Support-Vector-Machine

ex6 focuses on the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to gain an intuition on how the process works, including the use of linear and gaussian kernels. Three sample datasets: ex6data1.mat, ex6data2.mat and ex6data3.mat were used to demonstrate this concept.

ex6_spam involves the utilization of SVM algorithms to classify emails into spam or non-spam with high accuracy. The dataset use for this project is based on a subset of the SpamAssassin Public Corpus.
